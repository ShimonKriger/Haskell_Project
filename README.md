# Haskell_Project
Programming Languages Project:
This is a collection of Haskell programs I wrote for my Programming Languages course. There are 3 programs, each of which is composed of several functions. The improved binary search program differs from the plain binary search program in that it returns the first instance of the element we seek, as opposed to returning whichever instance of the element the program chances upon first.
